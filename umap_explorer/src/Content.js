# About UMAP explorer

This is an interactive visualization that shows the embeddings obtained by applying the [UMAP algorithm](https://github.com/lmcinnes/umap) on the TAASRAD19 dataset. The original code of the visualization app is available [on github](https://github.com/GrantCuster/umap-explorer) and can be adapted or used as a reference for doing similar visualizations with different datasets or algorithms. The code was made available by [grantcuster@gmail.com](mailto:grantcuster+umap@gmail.com).

The images shown in the visualization are generated with the Jupyter notebook present in the original repository.
